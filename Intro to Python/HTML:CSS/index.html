<p>Can you find Waldo? He is very Hidden and I would be surprised if you found him. Most people don't find him because this test is just too diffucult. If you can even spot it, you are already above 50% of the population. If you can spot it in under 2 hours, you are above 75% of the population. If you can even spot it in an hour, you may be among the smartest minds alive. The world record is 10 seconds which is seemingly unbeatable. Just give it a go because I believe in you!</p>
